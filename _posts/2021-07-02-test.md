#### Millennial

Millennial is a minimalist Jekyll blog theme that I built from scratch. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for a publication or blog.

Feel free to check out <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/" target="_blank">the demo</a>, where you’ll also find instructions on <a href="https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/documentation/getting-started.html">how to use install</a> and use the theme.

#### Jekyll Starter Kit

The Jekyll Starter Kit is a simple framework for starting your own Jekyll project using all of the best practices that I learned from building my other Jekyll themes.

Feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul/jekyll-starter-kit" target="_blank">the GitHub repository</a>, where you’ll also find instructions on how to use install and use the theme.
